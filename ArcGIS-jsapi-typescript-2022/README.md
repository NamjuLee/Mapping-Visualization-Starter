 ### About this sample

This sample TypeScript application uses the ArcGIS API for JavaScript ES modules (ESM), also referred to as [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core). It uses a lightweight framework called [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) to compile the application locally on your machine.

When you install @arcgis/core, the TypeScript definitions are included. If you are new to TypeScript, the sample code looks like normal ESM. However, if you are using a TypeScript-enabled development environment such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript), then you will get the benefits of intellisense and real-time type verification, in addition to compile-time type checking.

### Requirements

Be sure your machine has Node.js, NPM and a webserver installed. Refer to the SDK's [ES Modules guide topic](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/#prerequisites) for more information.

### Install

To install sample and its dependencies, run `npm install`.

### Run the sample

To run the sample use `npm run dev`. This will compile the application and enabled you to launch it in a browser window.
